# MILESTONEPROJECT 1 - PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

This is my portfolio website with an overview of my skills, experiences and projects. 
Made for recruiters who may be interested in hireing me and want to see my work. The website reflects my current situation 
and is designed to easily be added on when there are new projects to show. The website 
is responsive, accessible on many devices, and easy to navigate.

### DESIGN
   •	Color schemes<br>
   The two main colours used throughout the website are dark blue and orange/copper. 
   Blue to give a formal impression and gain confidence. Orange as an accent colour, because it is welcoming, playful and symbolizes creativity. It is also a good call to action colour. Blue and orange are complementary colours and bring the best out of each other. Both are a nice contrast to white. 

###	TYPOGRAPHY
The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font and easy to read. The font Poppins is used for variation, for contact information and quotes to 
make them stand out. 

### IMAGERY
a.	The hero image is supposed to give the website a personal expression and make the user feel welcome. <br> 
b.	The images on the portfolio/concept development section are supposed to give a feeling of what the concept brings and are from Kinnarps AB, the company how owns the concept. <br>
c.	The image on the portfolio/digital learing section I have build myself because the print screens from the authoring tool for e-learning didn’t have the right quality to be display on a website. <br>
d.	Two of the images on the portfolio/trainings & events section are from unsplash.com, the third one with a truck is my own photo. <br>
